# Walkthrough

## 1

On the login page, a little below, there is a message about creating an account. Press Ctrl+U, and then you will see green inscription:

```
-- use guest:guest credentials until registration is fixed. "admin" user account is off limits!!!!! --
```

## 2

So let's go back to our page and enter the login: guest and password: guest

After that, you will see a registration congratulation message, and most importantly, you should pay attention to the search bar where you will see `/profile.php?user=guest`

## 3(final)

All that's left for you is to change "guest" to "admin" and after that, you will see the long-awaited flag.
